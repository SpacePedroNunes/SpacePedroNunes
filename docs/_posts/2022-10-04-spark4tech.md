# SPARK 4 TECH Open Call is launched!

ESA Space Solutions Portugal has opened applications for SPARK 4 TECH, a programme that supports Portuguese companies interested in transferring space technology for the benefit of Earth. Applications are open until 4 November 2022.

SPARK 4 TECH aims to fund technical and economic feasibility studies of the transfer of technology used in space in terrestrial applications, in order to prove the relevance of a technology/know-how from space to another technological field, as well as to reduce the business risk and confirm the market opportunity.

Each project will receive up to 50.000 euros of funding, corresponding to 50% of the total eligible costs (100.000 euros), during the six months of the feasibility study, and access to other ESA funding opportunities. Portuguese entities, companies operating in the space or non-space sector (including SMEs) and academic and research organisations can apply.

SPARK 4 TECH is an initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA) with the support of the Portuguese Space Agency and ANACOM.
