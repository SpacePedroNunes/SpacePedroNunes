&lt;p&gt;ESA Space Solutions Portugal has opened applications for SPARK 4 TECH, a programme that supports Portuguese companies interested in transferring space technology for the benefit of Earth. Applications are open until 4 November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPARK 4 TECH aims to fund technical and economic feasibility studies of the transfer of technology used in space in terrestrial applications, in order to prove the relevance of a technology/know-how from space to another technological field, as well as to reduce the business risk and confirm the market opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each project will receive up to 50.000 euros of funding, corresponding to 50% of the total eligible costs (100.000 euros), during the six months of the feasibility study, and access to other ESA funding opportunities. Portuguese entities, companies operating in the space or non-space sector (including SMEs) and academic and research organisations can apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPARK 4 TECH is an initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA) with the support of the Portuguese Space Agency and ANACOM.&lt;/p&gt;
